Draw an imaginary line, 1 mm wide, with unlimited height above and below between any part of the base of the mark and the centre of that Strafing Run token. Using the ranged weapon below, make a shooting attack against the mark and each other operative that has a base crossed by that line. For those shooting attacks, when determining if an other operative is a valid target and if it is in Cover, draw Visibility and Cover lines from the mark, and if they are in Cover provided by Light terrain or another operative, they are treated as having an Engage order for that attack instead.",
